# Image-Classifier
The objective of image classification is to identify and portray, as a unique gray level (or color), 
the features occurring in an image in terms of the object or type of land cover these features actually 
represent on the ground. Image classification is perhaps the most important part of digital image analysis.
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and 
a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
